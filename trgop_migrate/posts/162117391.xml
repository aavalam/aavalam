<p>This week I needed to send a git repository over to another machine without access to my repository. &nbsp;I wanted to keep it intact.</p>
<p>So here comes the git bundle command to the rescue.</p>
<p>First I had to find the references that I needed to bundle, and I found that the hash for the initial commit was f787346 (short form) and then performed this command:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; git bundle create my_cool_project.bundle master f787e46</p>
<p>I then moved it to my desktop just to work on it for a moment and confirm that it was intact.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; mv my_cool_project.bundle ~/Desktop/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; cd ~/Desktop/</p>
<p>Once I had it in place, I decided to clone it (though I could have simply done a git ls-remote my_cool_project.bundle to check the references, or a git verify my_cool_project.bundle) right there on my desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; git clone my_cool_project.bundle&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will give an error if the branch doesn't exist, as I found out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; git clone my_cool_project.bundle -b master</p>
<p>This provided a master branch for me, and I am ready to go.</p>
<p>Remember, a .bundle file is simply a git repository that is 'bundled' so you are free to fetch or pull or merge or clone it. &nbsp;You are also not restricted to naming it with a .bundle extension. &nbsp;But it may help to idenitfy the file later.</p>
