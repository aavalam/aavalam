Do you see trends in administration or other work? What’s the future for Ruby?</div><br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Jamie&gt;&gt; You can’t deny that Rails is going to be a big part of Ruby for quite a while, it was certainly the catalyst for a lot of people to gain an interest. It’s hard to say what the future will hold, but there’s definitely a trend to push the uses of the framework to a new level. RubyCocoa and Shoes are pushing the boundaries on the GUI development branch of use, and system administration scripting is also something I’ve seen used quite often myself and have seen others use. It won’t replace the other languages, of course, but I think it’s finding a solid place in the ranks of general use languages.</blockquote><p />See the rest of the interview at the link above!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2949792777916502048-3099439573947474312?l=vgoff.blogspot.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>]]></content:encoded>
