<p>Often when I want to tell someone about cool projects I’m watching on GitHub, I can’t remember their names. Now wouldn’t it be nice if I could look them up without actually having to open a browser tab, logging into the site and so on? Here’s a quick script to do just that:</p>

<p>I know that there are several gems for interacting with GitHub, but thanks to the awesome <a href="http://citizen428.net/exit.php?url_id=4778&amp;entry_id=431" title="http://httparty.rubyforge.org/">HTTParty</a> it takes about as long to just implement the relevant part of the <span>API</span> yourself as it would take to actually find said gems, install them and glance over their docs. In case this looks a bit over-engineered, I have a couple more ideas I might add in the future, so I already prepared the code for that (e.g. the API_METHODS hash). Once I do that I’ll also not hardcode the user name, separate out… who am I kidding, it’s just another throwaway script, but at least it’s somewhat useful…</p>

<p>Very nice, I was just looking at some <a href="http://github.com/defunkt/gist">http://github.com/defunkt/gist</a> code... Very useful information, and nice use of ruby and HTTParty.</p>
