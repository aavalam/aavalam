<h3>Build a Hash with Derivative Values </h3>

<div class='post_body'><p>Creating a Hash from Arrays in Ruby is a pretty trivial matter.  You can use Array.zip or map or blocks, for example.</p>

<p>One thing that I haven&rsquo;t found yet is how to create easily, hashes from things that have a base unit of measure, and that build upon
themselves&hellip; for example, in the case of a Yard as a measurement, you have 1 Yard, 3 Feet, 12 Inches and so on.  The important part here is this: 1 yard is the base unit, there are 3 feet in a yard, and 12 inches in a foot.  So don&rsquo;t skip the foot unit, when thinking of inches&hellip; other wise the units will not build right in the hash.</p>

<p><a href="#Ihavecreated" title="Not the two line version, this version was created by Michael Kohl, I created the original, and he reduced it to this version!">I have built</a> a not-so-well-named method that will create the values necessary for creating some nice hashes from derived values.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="function">build_hash_with_derivative_values</span>(units, property)
  properties = (property.inject([<span class="integer">1</span>]) { |a,v| a &lt;&lt; v*a[<span class="integer">-1</span>] })[<span class="integer">1</span>..<span class="integer">-1</span>]
  units.zip(properties).inject({}) { |h, (k,v)| h[k] = v ; h }
<span class="keyword">end</span></pre></div>
</div>


<p>In order to use it, it only requires the unit names that make up the base name, and in the same order, the values that make up that unit
from the next smaller unit, each supplied as an array.</p>

<p>So, for the yard, as in the above discussion, I would do this&hellip;</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>yardstick = build_hash_with_derivative_values [<span class="symbol">:yard</span>, <span class="symbol">:foot</span>, <span class="symbol">:inch</span>], [<span class="integer">1</span>, <span class="integer">3</span>, <span class="integer">12</span>]
<span class="comment"># =&gt; {:inch=&gt;36, :foot=&gt;3, :yard=&gt;1}</span></pre></div>
</div>


<p>Nice and easy sample, but it is nice and easy for more complex units
too.  For example if you wanted to create a hash of the properties of
a century, I may do something like this:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>century_properties = build_hash_with_derivative_values [<span class="symbol">:century</span>, <span class="symbol">:decade</span>, <span class="symbol">:year</span>,       <span class="symbol">:day</span>, <span class="symbol">:hour</span>, <span class="symbol">:minute</span>, <span class="symbol">:second</span>],
                                                       [       <span class="integer">1</span>,      <span class="integer">10</span>,    <span class="integer">10</span>, <span class="float">365.242199</span>,    <span class="integer">24</span>,      <span class="integer">60</span>,      <span class="integer">60</span>]
<span class="comment"># =&gt; {:second=&gt;3155692599.36, :minute=&gt;52594876.656, :hour=&gt;876581.2776, :day=&gt;36524.2199, :year=&gt;100, :decade=&gt;10, :century=&gt;1}</span></pre></div>
</div>


<p>You notice that I simply build it up on easy to know values, based on the next smaller unit, instead of having to really put a lot of thought into what the calculated values are.</p>

<p>But the nice thing is, I really don&rsquo;t have to do a lot of calculations when I am trying to determine a Hash table based on derived values.  I just pick the base value, and go from there.</p>

<p>From there, it is easy to ask those conversion questions&hellip;</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>century_properties[<span class="symbol">:minute</span>] / century_properties[<span class="symbol">:hour</span>] * <span class="integer">3</span>  <span class="comment"># how many minutes in 3 hours?</span>
<span class="comment"># =&gt; 180</span>
yardstick[<span class="symbol">:inch</span>] / yardstick[<span class="symbol">:foot</span>] * <span class="float">1.5</span> <span class="comment"># how many inches in 1.5 feet?</span>
=&gt; <span class="float">18.0</span></pre></div>
</div>


<p>I need to explain that in an hour means &ldquo;per hour&rdquo; and of course, per means a division of units.  This is important when using this to get the answers you want.</p>

<p>An exercise for the reader&hellip; create a hash using this method with 1 meter as the base, and the six other &lsquo;mostly&rsquo; common units that surround it.  For me, my mind wanted to jump units, rather than relying on the next one on the list.</p></div>
