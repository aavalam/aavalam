<div style="padding: 0px;">
<strong style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Jay&gt;&gt;</strong> The market for Ruby programmers is the best programmer market I’ve ever seen. I missed the dotcom bubble, and I hear it was better back then, but not by much.</div>
<div style="padding: 0px;">Last year, a bank offered me $174k a year to do Ruby (Rails). I know independent contractors asking for $100-$150 an hour, and getting more work than they can handle.</div>
<div style="padding: 0px;">It’s not just about the money though, the companies that are hiring Ruby developers are usually fun, forward-thinking, and agile organizations. Even if you aren’t getting paid buckets of money, chances are the work environment is a good one.</div>
<div style="padding: 0px;">I get several emails a week about opportunities. Most sound like great places to work, though I’m always a bit skeptical about some of the start-ups. Justin Ghetland once told me to avoid any start-up work unless there’s no doubt in my mind that the idea is going to work. I think Justin’s advice is spot on. Last year I almost joined a start-up that was going to pay me quite well, and they already had customers lined up. It seemed like a good situation, but the timing ended up being problematic. In the end, I got lucky, they ran out of cash about 6 months into it. There’s just so many great jobs out there that going with a start-up right now doesn’t seem like a risk worth taking.</div>
<span style="line-height: 19px; font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: black;">If I were looking for a job right now I’d be talking to <a href="http://www.forwardtechnology.co.uk/" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(35, 97, 161); text-decoration: underline;">Forward</a>, <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(35, 97, 161); text-decoration: underline;">Relevance</a>, and <a href="http://www.hashrocket.com/" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(35, 97, 161); text-decoration: underline;">Hashrocket</a>. If I were just learning Ruby, I’d be reading the blogs that those guys maintain and I’d be emailing them for ideas on how to improve.</span>
