</div><p />Hmm... Seems like it is pretty strange, but Google Chrome doesn't seem<br />to work well with Google Mail.  I am trying to write this message to<br />the blog, and my cursor keeps getting bumped to the end of the message<br />window, each time someone on my chat list updates their status.<p>Very frustrating.  It doesn't seem to happen constantly, but then the<br />status doesn't constantly change.  Just enough that I didn't notice it<br />until today.</p><p>I like it, don't get me wrong, and I think they are on the right<br />track.  It plays well in my limited memory, and for the most part is<br />very nice and light.  But especially on Google sites, I would think<br />it would at least play exceptionally well.</p><p>Fortunately, Google seems to have a pretty fast update cycle...<br />Release early, update often.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2949792777916502048-7789643939255565120?l=vgoff.blogspot.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>]]></content:encoded>
