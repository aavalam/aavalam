</p>I know that each time I want to ask a user for something, I need to<br />write a way to ensure that the user sees the prompt, so that an<br />appropriate answer can be provided.  It makes sense to provide a<br />method to do this, as it seems to be a pretty routine thing.<p>I do this by extending String with method prompt.  It is easy to use,<br />and ensures that stdout is flushed so that the user will get the<br />question.  If you find it useful, feel free to use it!</p><p>Maybe the method will be included some day as a core feature!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2949792777916502048-8960817569281077711?l=vgoff.blogspot.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div></div>
