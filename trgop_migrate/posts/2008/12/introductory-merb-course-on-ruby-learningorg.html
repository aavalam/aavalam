<div class='post_body'>We are a little past the halfway through the Beta Inroductory MERB-Ruby course, and it has gone quite well so far.<p />The plan is to open the course to the public in the 2nd week of January.  I can't wait for it to start.<p />At Ruby Learning, we like to have a beta course, so that we can go through the courses ourselves, and get the rough edges worked out, so that you get the best possible course we can have.  Of course, we don't stop there.<p />With  your help, we continue to improve all of our our courses, and we invite you to participate when this course becomes available as well<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2949792777916502048-4105460895047175817?l=vgoff.blogspot.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div></div>
