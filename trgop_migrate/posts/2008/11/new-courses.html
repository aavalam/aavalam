<div class='post_body'>Of course, you may already be aware of the Free Online Ruby 'Core' course being offered at <a href="http://rubylearning.com">http://rubylearning.com</a>.<p /><div>But I wanted to mention the works of a "Testing Basics'' course being developed, and should be available soon.</div><p /><div>Satoshi is also offering a Shoes Course, that has been mentioned by none other than _Why (that lucky stiff!).  Oh, I meant Satoshi, but _Why, too.</div><p /><div>In either case, Satoshi has been hard at work improving the course, and _Why has been busy developing Shoes, and both are excellent reasons to sign up for the $5.00 course!</div><p /><div>There are a few other projects currently underway, and with any luck, there may be a couple of 'full-time' course offerings.  Of course, even current courses are always under development, due to active participants!  It is part of what makes RubyLearning.Org a great place to learn!</div><p /><div>Hope to see you there!</div><p /><p /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2949792777916502048-997811141971926761?l=vgoff.blogspot.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div></div>
