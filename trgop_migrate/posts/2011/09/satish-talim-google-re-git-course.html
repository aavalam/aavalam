Git is an open source version control system designed to handle very large projects with speed and efficiency, but just as well suited for small personal repositories (collection of resources that is accessed to retrieve information); it is especially popular in the open source community.

Please +1 this post so that I can decide whether to conduct it here. Comments appreciated.</blockquote>
