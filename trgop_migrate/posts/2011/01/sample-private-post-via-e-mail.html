Send that kind of information with a good Title as the Subject line,
and e-mail to <a href="mailto:private@vgoff.posterous.com">private@vgoff.posterous.com</a> and I will get notification
of a private blog post, and will publish it after review and edit
process.
Code formatting can be done easily either by including a gist link, or
by using markdown (I can give you the markdown instructions, but
basically http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) with the
Ruby code blocks being able to be invoked by doing this:
    #!ruby
    def hello string
      "Hello #{string}&ldquo;
    end</p>

post</a>
For example, I am cc'ing this to Posterous as a private post, so that
I can send you the link and we will see how it presents itself in this
format (I won&rsquo;t edit it) to fix any problems with it.</p></div>
