</div><p />Well, was waiting for today, to check out Google Chrome.  Wasn't sure what was going to happen with it.  But I have used it for most of the day, today.  I have been pretty impressed with the speed.  Seems to be a bit quicker.<p /><div>I have looked at the task manager (press Shift - ESC) and you can see which pages are taking up memory, and can individually end that process, rather than the entire browser, which I find to be AWESOME!</div><p /><div>I do use Google quite a bit, and would appreciate some use of Google Bookmarks facility on the tool bar.  But have been pretty successful with Google Chrome so far.  It is probably better to worry about browser speed and functionality, rather than extentions, they will come soon enough, if the product is well taken.</div><p /><div>Another thing that I noticed that I like is the "inspect element" option if you right click on a web page.  It looks like they developed in part for web page development, as well.  I do not 'normally' design web pages, so this is one of the last things I was checking out... but already, I can see it may end up being a function of Chrome that I use pretty often.</div><p /><div>I will be using this for a few more days, at least.  I hope to see how it performs on Google Docs, and some other of their sites.</div><p /><div>Overall, I like how it looks, and how it acts.  We will see if it replaces Firefox or Seamonkey as my GWB (Graphical Web Browser).</div><p /><div>
