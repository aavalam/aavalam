<p>This is a representation of the layout of the forums that you will find.</p>
<p>This is from the 3rd week, which is incidentally the one with the most individual exercises to complete, and yet only one challenge.</p>

As Satish writes in his <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2012/03/12/ruby-programming-32nd-batch-registrations-now-open/" title="RubyLearning Blog" target="_blank">description of the course</a>&nbsp;it is a go at your own pace course: "you can login and start with the lessons any day and time and post your queries in the forum under the relevant lessons."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There aren't any webcasts so learning is generally asynchronous. &nbsp;But like I mentioned earlier, we do have an IRC Channel for getting together and it is a good place to get together to do some pair programming.</p>
<p>I just wanted to give a sneak peak of some of the things to look forward to in the course. &nbsp;We have organized it per week, and we leave the course material up for 4 weeks from the last day of the 7 week course.</p>
<p>Have you taken the course or are you looking to join?</p></div>
