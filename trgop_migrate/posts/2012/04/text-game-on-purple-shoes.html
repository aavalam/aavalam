<p>I read <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/395141">Jared's post</a> in ruby-talk ML.<p />He said,<p />&gt; my game is a long piece of code: <a href="https://gist.github.com/2500159">https://gist.github.com/2500159</a><br />&gt; <br />&gt; My question is, I have the game fully coded out in standard Ruby and it <br /> &gt; runs in terminal.&nbsp; I know I won't be able to simply call the class or <br />&gt; whatever and run it perfectly as it is.&nbsp; Ruby uses "puts" and Shoes uses <br />&gt; "para".&nbsp; Ruby uses "sleep" and Shoes uses "timer" and a do loop for it.<br /> &gt; <br />&gt; Is it going to be possible to have this run without doing a massive <br />&gt; rewrite or am I screwed on this?<p />Oh, umm,...<br />I think it's a bit difficult with Red Shoes... <br />But with Green or Purple?<p /> After some trials, got a solution for Purple Shoes.<br />I've not changed his original code, just only added a small snippet.<p />Look at the code ( <a href="https://gist.github.com/2516799">https://gist.github.com/2516799</a> ) and watch <a href="http://www.rin-shun.com/shoes/text-game-with-purple-shoes.swf.html">a tiny flush demo</a>. ;-)<p />ashbb</p>
