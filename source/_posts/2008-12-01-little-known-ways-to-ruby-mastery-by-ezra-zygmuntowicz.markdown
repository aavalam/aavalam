How do you see the market for Ruby Programmers in the work place, and do you see it as primarily tied to Rails and Web related work? Do you see trends in administration or other work? Whatâ€™s the future for Ruby?

Ruby is being used more and more as enterprise glue language and I think it really shines in that space.
