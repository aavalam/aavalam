A book(let) review.

A hands on guide for Ruby newbies to create and publish their first Ruby
gem.

Satish has published a booklet that takes you through the steps required
to publish your first Ruby Gem.  [{% img right http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZtM8-8HNL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-click,TopRight,35,-76_AA278_PIkin4,BottomRight,-55,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg 300 300 How Do I Create And Publish My First Ruby Gem? %}](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BECCKYM) Recently updated with information on
how to 'yank' your gem in case you don't need it to be available, it is
a good short reference to get you quickly started in the world of Ruby Gems.

There are tools out there that do the work for you in terms of having a
skeleton.  This booklet will cover none of those.  It will take you
through the basics to get a gem up and running in a few short minutes.

Yes, all the information is available for free.  And it is not that
difficult to find it all.  But dropping a dollar to have a handy
reference on your Kindle to support Satish's efforts on RubyLearning is
just a small way to say "Thanks!" and a way to show some love.
