I found a "Scalable Xen VPS Hosting for Developers" Private Beta, and I am officially inviting anyone that is interested, based on the following information. <!-- more -->

*Why ‘beta test’ webbynode?*

We are working hard on building great software to give our customers more options, we are not here to provide a ‘host-in-a-box’ solution - but rather a totally custom web application to let you manage your “webbys” more efficiently, create clusters between them, move them between different data-center locations, and more. But we need feed back from experienced VPS users like you.

*Benefits of becoming a Beta Tester*

* Get the 411 on our development progress!
* Participate in contests where we will be giving away free Lifetime Memberships, and iPod giveaways!
* Be part of a Community of developers & Linux enthusiasts
* Access to our amazing Article Library
* It’s FREE!
* Receive 100% FREE VPS Service for the beta testing period, and up to 50% discounts when we go live.

*Who’s a good candidate for Beta testing?*

* People with Linux & Server Management experience
* Interest in building Linux fail-over solutions using VPS.
* Enough knowledge to make these “webbys” rock-and-roll!
* Setup your own Hosting environment, and work with us in order to set you up with Failover and Cloud Storage services.
