I started to write a tiny study note for Shoes        
built-in samples.                                     
The first is [simple-accordion](http://github.com/ashbb/shoes_tutorial_html/tree/master/mdowns/01201_simple-accordion.mdown). I'm going to study one by one. ;-)

Hope it helps to read the Shoes (Ruby) code,
