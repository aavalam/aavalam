How do you see the market for Ruby Programmers in the work place, and do you see it as primarily tied to Rails and Web related work? Do you see trends in administration or other work? What’s the future for Ruby?

Thanks to the plethora of Virtual Machines out there I see Ruby as taking a larger role in the enterprise. With JRuby and Iron Ruby it’s already possible to contribute to large enterprise applications using the sweetest of languages. The power of Ruby also means that you end up with more maintainable code, which will lead to cost-savings across the board which I’m sure large corporations will seize upon.
