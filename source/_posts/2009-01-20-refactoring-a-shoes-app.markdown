Karmi's [Shoes Demonstration Apps](http://github.com/karmi/                shoes_demonstration_apps/tree/master) on github is so cool.  <!-- More -->

To learn Ruby and Shoes from his code, I attempted a bit refactoring and updated [Shoes Tutorial Note](http://github.com/ashbb/shoes_tutorial_html/blob/master/mdowns/00800_Relevant_web_sites__Links_.mdown).
