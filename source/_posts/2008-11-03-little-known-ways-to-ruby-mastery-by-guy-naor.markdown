How do you see the market for Ruby Programmers in the work place, and do you see it as primarily tied to Rails and Web related work? Do you see trends in administration or other work? Whatâ€™s the future for Ruby?

Currently Rails takes the biggest chunk of Ruby developers. But I see a strong future in other places like system administration. I believe this will grow as more people with Ruby experience enter the workforce. Big as it is, Ruby is still a tiny part of the overall market, the more people know and feel comfortable with it, the more places we will see it going. People tend to work with what they are comfortable in. Once you are as comfortable with Ruby as you are with bash for system admin, you will move to using Ruby a lot more. I expect this trend to accelerate in the next couple of years.
